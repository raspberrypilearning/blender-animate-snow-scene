It would be much better if the car drove between the trees and then towards the snowman. At about frame 40 (approx. 2 seconds) of the animation, the car needs to be between the trees.

Click **Play** to see what it looks like. It probably looks like the car is driving on ice. Quite funny, but good enough for now. Try to improve the animation.
