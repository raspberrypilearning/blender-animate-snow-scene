## What can you do now?

If you are following the [Blender](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/blender-basics){:target="_blank"} pathway, you can move on to the [Render a Snow Scene]() project, where you will output your animation as a video! 

<video width="560" height="315" controls>
<source src="resources/snow-scene-rendered.mkv" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support WebM video, try FireFox or Chrome
</video>


You could also try out another [Blender](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=blender){:target="_blank"} project, or have a go at putting your new 3D design skills to good use in the [Introduction to Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro){:target="_blank"} game development pathway!
