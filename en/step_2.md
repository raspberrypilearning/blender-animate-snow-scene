The first thing you should do when animating is check where the camera is.

Go to render view by pressing <kbd>F12</kbd> (or <kbd>FN + F12</kbd> if you're using a Mac) to see what the scene looks like.

The camera angle is not quite right, as you can only see the tip of the snowman's head at the bottom of the screen, and not the whole snowman.

--- task ---

Go to render view by pressing <kbd>F12</kbd> (<kbd>FN + F12</kbd> on a Mac) again to check whether you can now see the whole snowman.

If not, exit the render view and lower the camera a little bit more. 

--- /task ---

**Tips:**
+ If the camera is too low, pull it up a little bit instead. 
+ Continue rendering and checking until you have everything in view. 
+ If the scene is too dark, select the Lamp in the Collection (at the top right) and increase the Power value.
